# Treggo Beta

Treggo Beta is an open-source B2B order management platform designed for product providers, sales staff, and delivery teams. It allows businesses to easily manage product catalogs, place and track orders, and coordinate deliveries through a simple and self-hosted solution.

Both parts work together to deliver a seamless experience for managing products, orders, and deliveries.
